_Packages done right™_

[![Build Status][ci-master-badge]][ci-master] [![Dev Branch Build Status][ci-dev-badge]][ci-dev]

Every package here has been carefully crafted to the highest level of perfection.

Features that the vast majority of my ebuilds has in common:

 - code in ebuilds is **clean and documented**, thus making packages maintainable and easily updatable
 - **USE flags** are provided for almost any configurable option
     - instead of packing multitude of options under a single feature as _Gentoo™_ devs do
 - full **_systemd_** integration (services, templates, timers, ...), no _OpenRC_/_cron_ support
     - note that only recent versions of _systemd_ are supported (cca. only the last 3-4 releases)
 - sane **default configurations** (default USE-flags, config files, ...)
 - **locales** support (`nls`/`l10n_*` USE-flags)
     - _Gentoo™_ packages mostly install all locales unconditionally
 - **x86_64**/**armv6**/**armv7**/**armv8** architectures only
     - this allows me to remove clutter introduced by Gentoo devs for exotic arches
 - only the **native ABI** is supported, again to reduce the clutter
 - no _libav_, _libressl_, ... support

In most package directories there is a _README_ file that says why is my package superior to any other out there including the "official" one.

> _If you find a package superior to mine, please [report it here][New issue], so that I can improve it even more._

You can also visit a user-friendly [list of packages][LISTING].
I highly encourage you to browse through the list as the chances are high for you to discover some great new software.


Quality Assurance
------------------

You should be able to use any package from my overlay without regrets, because I do and I have quite high standards.
To achieve this goal I'm using several safety guards:

- my brain of course
- _[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)_, which runs:
    - _[repoman](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Repoman)_ checks
    - _[shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)_ checks
    - custom checks
- all points of _GitHub_'s feature called _[protected branches]_, which means that all merges to _master_ must pass CI tests

This all, of course, doesn't prevent build failures, missing dependencies, etc. So, should you find
some issues, please send me a PR (if you know how to fix it), or at least [file an issue][New issue].


How to install this overlay
----------------------------

### Manually (recommended)

#### 1. Add an entry to [`/etc/portage/repos.conf`](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/repos.conf):

```ini
[rindeal]
## set this to any location you want
location = /var/cache/portage/repos/rindeal
## prefer gentoo-mirror which includes metadata cache, but introduces a delay (<6hours) for hotfixes
sync-uri =  https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/rindeal.git
## otherwise use the one and only original source
#sync-uri = https://github.com/rindeal/gentoo-overlay.git
sync-type = git
auto-sync = yes
## prefer my packages over the Gentoo™ ones to improve UX and stability (recommended by 9/10 IT experts)
#priority = 9999
```

#### 2. Sync

```sh
# Preferrably
eix-sync
# or if you need to
emerge --sync
```

### Automatically with Layman

```sh
layman -o 'https://github.com/rindeal/gentoo-overlay/raw/master/repositories.xml' -a rindeal
# or more simply
layman -a rindeal
```
